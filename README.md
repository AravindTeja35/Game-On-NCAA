# Game On: Predictive Analytics for Women's Basketball Ticket Sales

**Introduction**

This project leverages predictive analytics to revolutionize ticket sales strategies for Women’s NCAA Basketball. Our project underscores the sport's growing popularity and its economic impact, aiming to enhance ticket sales through precise forecasting. By analyzing Women’s Basketball customer data, supplemented with external datasets, we provide forecasts on customer purchasing behavior, enabling stakeholders to strategically navigate ticket sales in the primary and secondary markets.

**Objective**

Our goal is to develop predictive models that accurately forecast ticket purchasing behavior among Women’s Basketball fans. These models help identify:

Whether a customer will purchase a ticket.
The market through which the ticket will be purchased (primary or secondary).
This initiative aims to maximize revenue, improve operational efficiency, and enhance the customer experience.
